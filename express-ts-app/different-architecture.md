# Different Architecture Types

Software architecture defines the high-level structure of a software system, specifying its components and their interactions. Various architectural styles exist, each with unique characteristics and suited for different use cases. Below are some common architectural types, their features, and distinctions.

---

## 1. Layered Architecture (N-tier Architecture)

### Characteristics
- Organizes system into layers (e.g., Presentation, Business Logic, Data Access).
- Each layer has specific responsibilities.
- Layers communicate only with adjacent layers.
- Promotes separation of concerns.

### Use Cases
- Enterprise applications
- Systems requiring clear modularization

### Distinction
- Strict hierarchy of layers.
- Easy to maintain and test individual layers.
- Can cause performance overhead due to multiple layers.

---

## 2. Client-Server Architecture

### Characteristics
- Divides system into clients and servers.
- Clients request services; servers process and respond.
- Servers are centralized and manage data/storage.

### Use Cases
- Web applications
- Database systems

### Distinction
- Clear division of roles.
- Centralized control on server side.
- Can scale by adding more clients or servers.

---

## 3. Microservices Architecture

### Characteristics
- Breaks application into small, independent services.
- Each service runs in its own process and communicates over network protocols (HTTP, messaging).
- Services can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

### Use Cases
- Large-scale distributed systems
- Systems requiring scalability and continuous deployment

### Distinction
- High modularity and decoupling.
- More complex infrastructure and operational overhead.
- Enables polyglot development (different languages/technologies per service).

---

## 4. Event-Driven Architecture

### Characteristics
- Components communicate by producing and consuming events.
- Often uses message brokers or event buses.
- Decouples components by asynchronous communication.

### Use Cases
- Real-time systems
- Applications requiring high scalability and responsiveness

### Distinction
- Loose coupling and high scalability.
- Complex event management.
- Harder to trace flow and debug.

---

## 5. Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)

### Characteristics
- Similar to microservices but with more emphasis on enterprise service buses (ESBs).
- Services expose business functionalities over standardized protocols (SOAP, REST).
- Promotes reuse of services.

### Use Cases
- Large enterprise systems integrating multiple legacy systems.
- Systems needing interoperability.

### Distinction
- Focuses on business-level service reuse.
- Often heavier infrastructure than microservices.
- Emphasizes contract and message standards.

---

## 6. Peer-to-Peer Architecture

### Characteristics
- No central server; nodes (peers) act as both clients and servers.
- Each peer shares resources with others.
- Decentralized and distributed.

### Use Cases
- File sharing networks
- Blockchain networks

### Distinction
- High resilience and fault tolerance.
- Complexity in managing peer discovery and consistency.
- No single point of failure.
